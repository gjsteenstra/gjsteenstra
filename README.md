Hi, Iâ€™m gertjan and live & work in Amsterdam
I have been working in communication as a trainer and actor for more than 20 years now. 
Two months ago I started working on a career switch to webdeveloper with "The complete webdeveloper ; Zero to mastery" van Andrei)
I'm still a beginner but have a high level of analytical thinking and problem solving and a good overview on complex matters.
I'm open for any kind of basic projects that wil give me a chance to develop more skills and build up a network of professionals.
